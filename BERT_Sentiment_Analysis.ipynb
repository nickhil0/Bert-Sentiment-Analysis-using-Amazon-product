       "['Boat brand was unknown to me. I gave it a shot and bought these earphones after reading several positive reviews. For this price there are no other better earphones out there. First thing I noticed was how strong the connecting cables were, much tougher and sturdier as compared to other well known brands. The earpieces also fit tightly into the ears and seem on the harder side. They will never fall off from the ears. Sound quality is above average as compared to their next product in the hierarchy. Frankly the only missing part is the heavy bass.(this comparison is unfair as I also use Sony XB 550) Other than that an excellent product.',\n",
       " \"Felt like Cheap Chinese Headphones in some nice packing.Go for Sennheiser, I wasn't able to wear then single day.Pro - So Loud at full they can even bleed your ears too.Cons- High bass driven outshines the highs and the mids ( Vocals lie deep down that boom boom)- Not that comfortable to wear.- even design is So called hawk but it is not if comfort is considered.Choice is Yours.\",\n",
       " 'Having used SoundMagic ES18s, JBL C200SI and Sennheiser CX 180 Street II which are known top selling. This product is breaks the budget market segment. Here is my verdict:Pros: 1. Great for Bass lovers. 2. Overall clarity of output is quite good. 3. Eye catchy design. 4. Mic performance is good on calls. 5. Decent wire length.Cons: 1. The wire is of high quality but feels too rubbery.One of the best in ear earphones if you are looking for daily use and do not want to spend much on an earphone.Overall the sound quality is too good for its price. I would recommend this product especially for phone usage.',\n",
       " \"Okay product. Will comment in 3-6 months regarding durability.These are supposed to be basshead earphones but I don't think they qualify - not at their price range.They don't really boost bass just amplify it and make the entire lower range frequency louder. As a result, if you go above the halfway volume mark, the sound sort of starts cracking and hurting ears. The problem goes away a bit when you tweak the sound settings. However, the range is small. If you optimize settings for bass, then treble starts cracking, and if you optimise for middle range sounds (can't really get a good treble), then bass starts cracking. Just not satisfactory for me.Of course, everyone's taste in music is different and their requirements from earphones are different. Obviously, I listen to everything from Opera and Death metal to bluegrass and hip-hop to rap and jazz to Punjabi upbeat songs and Ghazals. So this earphone covers only a fraction of all that and hence I do not particularly like them even for the price of rs 379 that I paid in the lightning deal. There were a few cheaper earphones that were much better than these and I only bought this because they were out of stock.However, if your taste in music covers a narrow frequency range and similar genres and you just want loud percussion sounds and don't care about much else, go for it.As for watching TV shows and Movies, earphones generally don't affect the experience that much unless they are too good or too bad. However, here too, I find that the sound gets annoying if the volume is too high and I cannot eat while watching because it amplifies the sound of my jaw too much. Plus it makes everything sound a little weird. But I guess the last part gets adjusted with use.All in all, I will try a different pair next time. I mainly checked the reviews and bought them because they were rated high on durability. If they break soon, then there will be no point in me ever buying them again. I will see how long they last.\",\n",
       " 'honestly saying, i was influenced to buy this product from my friend who is already using this product. i opted this over sony as this product is giving better sounds than that. i purchased this product and after few days of using, the left earphone started to give odd sounds. it actually giving symptoms of not going to work in future, exactly what happened within  days. it completely stopped working.i thought a product defect and applied for warranty (used for one month). then i came to know that the same problem my friend is also facing with the same earphones. his earphones also got the same wire issue.so i better suggest you to not buy this product.thank you.',\n",

       " \"What I dislike about this earphone is its design. It is not at all ergonomic.There are some significant flaws. I write this, after having used Mi red phones which are in the same price range -300-400/-1. The ear buds are too small and don't give you that tight grip feel. It will fall off in the slightest of activity2. Position of mic: The mic is situated very low, at the point of intersection between 2 strings. It literally falls till you lower chest. So while talking on phone you have to hold the mic up manually near your mouth. In Mi earphones mic is placed near the right ear string, at a height near your face. That makes it easy to talk while earphones are on.3. The connecting cable at the point where you plugin to your phone is too long. That makes it prone to a lot of bending.This may cause early breakage.Having owned both earphones, I would recommend Mi over Boat.Voice quality is similar. Just above decent\",\n",

Sound quality - Ok, so if you remove the price factor, these headphones are no better than low end skullcandy ones. Bass reproduction is limited to mostly thumping. You won\\'t get much of that deep harmonic bass. Maybe, for this price, this is what you get. Don\\'t get lured by the price, if you want great sound quality, go for the higher end ones.',\n",

The design is very beautiful and unique and the color range is very impressive. Impressive sound quality with moderately good bass effects (come on guys look at the price) Comes with extra ear pads and a velcro starp for holding extra wire length.

The sound is flat, so less bass in regular condition! But the earphone has got a very good frequency range. So still a deep bass is possible but with an equalizer. You can try my preset. Also remember that the quality of sound also depends on your device's sound card.This is a very great earphone with a good quality sound, but it's not for rough usage! The sound is flat, so less bass in regular condition! But the earphone has got a very good frequency range. So still a deep bass is possible but with an equalizer. You can try my preset. Also remember that the quality of sound also depends on your device's sound card.- Everyone have different different taste of sound so will depend on personal preference- The main thing is the sound it is really good and clear , bass is a bit high but it is really good- built quality is also pretty good it is made of plastic and wire quality is very good it is very thick and can easily last for a year and more- I am also using Sennheiser CX 180 but it cost almost 700 and this one is for half the price- Best thing this earphone having 1 year of replacement warranty- Mic performance is good on calls- Wire length is also very good- The best thing is the design it feel really comfortable after 2 hours also- One of my friend is using RHA MA390 earphone and I showed him this earphones he was also very surprised that at this price also you can get really good earphonesOverall awesome purchase in terms of price to performance and sound quality, Go for it without thinking twice .Love the sound quality, but moreover the services offered by this company are pretty amazing!I ordered these earphones about 9 months ago and one of the ear buds stopped working about two weeks ago, I read about their manufacturer's warranty, and registered my product on their site and filed a complaint. They, then, picked up the earphones from my address, and sent a brand new one to the same address in two weeks and free of cost.\",\n",
       " 'I ordered this for the sake of communicating when my main headphones fatigue my ears. You obviously hear the difference between a 10K headphones and these, and these do the job. I haven’t used these on my phone (yet) and was only using on PC.Sound: Sound is okay. You hear others clearly as you would on a mid range-expensive headphones. These do not hit the bass as much and has a weird built-in reverb to it. Would give it 4/4/6.5 for Bass/Mids/Treble.Build: Sucks. Wire is not braided and seems fine for the price and I would not pull too hard to plug it off a jack. They yank outta the ear just fine. Driver housing is very cheap built, has some unfinished edges and seems like it’ll be crushed if you accidentaly sit on them.NC: They cancel out sound pretty good, way beyond my expectations from headphones this cheap. The tips themselves are a bit flimsy but they still do the job.Overall: Go for Sennheiser/Audio Technica by spending a little more.',\n",
       " \"Looking at the all reviews decided to go for it.So let's start with the Pros:- The build of it is excellent. That needs to be applauded. Strong wires, do not get tangled & are sturdy.- I love the matte black look. Look wise it's quite appealing.- Microphone is good too.Cons:- Dislike the earbuds quite much. They feel hard on contact. And that irritates me to no end. Since after sometime of wearing, it starts to hurt.- Sound quality could have been made better. Somehow it feels like, they stopped making it better right in the mid way of its completion.- The length of the wires could have been longer, that too bugs me.So overall. A basic, decent product. I use it largely for calls. Since it does the expected task. Thus okay with it. But not contented. Because it definitely could have been better.\",\n",

It has a button near the chest area, which can be used to pause music, skip track, hand up call, which is very convenient.A tip to all buyers :If you adjust the sound equaliser in your phone (player), you can enhance the output with added bass / treble, as per your choice.

I even used a case if I ever had to carry it anywhere. But still, the wire broke down.Rs. 100-150 roadside earphones at least works for a year or so.

Even after setting the equaliser to isolate just the bass, it sounds incredibly weak.Noise cancellation? I mean, if you stick two earplugs in your ear, you'd probably get better results. Don't fool yourself. It's an in-ear canal earphone, you'll get what you expect.Also, I don't care how stylish this looks, it is just impractical. You can't lie in bed with this. Turn your head a bit and it's gonna hurt. You have to adapt your usage to use it comfortably rather than the product being designed for comfort.\",\n",

But it becomes progressively unpleasant as you go higher volume levels. It actually hurts at high volume level.BUT the bass is very impressive and it is calibrated well for all volume levels.\",\n",

       " \"I got these for 399, and for that price these are pretty darn awesome. However it's not all awesome, it's got some flaws too. So here's the brief analysis:PROS:1. Awesome sound quality and great amount of bass.2. Good microphone.3. Earpads which help you put these things right into your ears, and they don't fall off, don't hurt your ears and you can lay down and jam to your songs with no problem at all!4. Button functionality which lets you accept/reject calls and navigate through your music tracks without having the need to unlock your phone everytime.5. Convenient cable length.CONS:1. Three consecutive short presses, which supposedly should switch to the previous track as mentioned in the manual in fact skips the next song and plays the song after that. The other button functions work fine. Don't know if it's a problem related to my phone (running a custom rom), or the specific item I got.2. The bass is quite loud, but sometimes it is a bit distorted. It seems as though the earphones force extra bass out....Again, for only 399, it's a great product. 4 stars ,only for the three short presses button action defect (and you don't expect great bass at such a low price). Nevertheless, these earphones live up to their name.\",\n",

I have bought Stone 200 and Stone grenade previously.Talking about this Mid-Range InEar headphone/earphone, this is fabulous.Design and Build Quality: No Gold Plated audio jack (no one cares of it) but the jack is covered with soft rubber which may give that joint a better strength. Cord quality is well enough. Has a dedicated mic in it with a single button which works well. Now the earbuds have such an ergonomic design that will feel you good and has rubber joint over there as well. So it will make it stronger. So overall it is strong enough.Sound Quality: Fabulous!! All 3 ranges are so well that you can put them on for hours without feeling any headache(it is tested by me for 5 hours). Noice cancellation works also very good. You can experience it while playing PUBG or on a call.Gaming Experience: I do play PUBG Mobile using it and overall it is good. Even on its maximum volume, you won't feel them SCREAMY and mic also works well in that. My only problem with it is if you are pushing the audio jack to any direction, you may feel that one of your earbud will stop working. It may be my phone's fault but I'm just telling its just a pin, not a screw which is fixed. So make sure you check your phone if the jack will get interrupted or not while holding your phone.My complaints: Though I clean my ears regularly, the buds gets dirty whenever I use them. So I have to clean them all time when I use them.Edit:Lifespan: Both earpieces lasted for around a year. After some days, one of them stopped working.

For the last 9 months, I have used these for more than 4 hours per day on an average, carried them in bag with other stuff like keys, comb, pens etc. but they still work just fine.Now.. Should you buy it?The answer to this, pretty much boils down to your need and budget.Who should purchase it?Someone who just wants a pair of earphones that plays the sound decently enough and lasts long at a minimum expense.Who shouldn't buy it?If you want every last details of your music crystal clear with all the bass then you should go for some high end product from complies like Sony, JBL, Bose.If you have a budget of more than Rs 1000 then you can certainly find a better pair than this one, in terms of sound quality.Hope this review has helped you in making a decision for your purchase.

Acc to me,Overall rating - 4.4/5Sound quality - 4.5/5, cause sound is kinda lil bit blunt(very slight) due to heavy bass setting otherwise it gives crystal clear sound.Noise cancellation - 4.7/5, it's kinda ok type in this rangeBass quality - 4.8/5, bass quality is just awesome but still I'll give it 4.8 cause it's best in this range but definitely not the best one as compared to heavy bass earphones/headphones.Design & build quality- 4.5/5, again it's one of the best earphone in this range, but wires are a bit thin, not tangle free & not for outside usage.Mic & In-call noise cancellation- 3.8/5 This is the only con, while on call I have to hold the mic near my mouth for talking otherwise the person on the other end says that they can't hear me properly & in call noise cancellation is average but not best.Actually I bought two earphones together last yr, one for myself & one for my brother.I've been using it for 1yr now without any issues & it supports both my phone & laptop. But idk what happened with my brother's earphones,the left earplug stops working sometimes maybe cause of his rough usage & it happened just 3months ago. So at the end all I can say that GO FOR THIS EARPHONE, IT'S BEST IN THIS BUDGET & WORKS WITH EVERYTHING LIKE CALLING, MUSIC & GOOGLE MEET/ZOOM MEETINGS & IT'S GOOD FOR LONG TERM USAGE BUT TOTALLY DEPENDS ON HOW YOU USE IT & HANDLE IT.\",\n",
       " \"Day 8:One side (right) of the earphone stopped working 🤨Day 1:Good earphones for this price.I liked:- Amazon delivery service- Build quality- sound quality (very nice)- packaging- pouch to keep the earphones safe- extra earbuds- small complement - boat welcro (it's a nice touch)I expected (but no luck):- punchy bass - it has only regular bass (nothing boosted)PS:I had Sony mdr xb 30 ex - lost it :( - none of the new earphones can be compared to it - Sony stopped it's production.This earphones is nothing compared to Sony\",\n",
       " \"The earphones are budget ones and they don't last that great.Mine got damaged near the jack area and I had to repair it after returning from the service center multiple times.The warranty is there and they do replace it but it's like a fish market and most of the time the response is that it will come after 20 days.Hence,decided to self repair rather than waiting for so many days and taking the pain of wasting time for replacement.\",\n",

I raised a service request in boAT portal, to my surprise the request was acted immediately the pick-up was arranged next day itself, but  due to my personal reason i could not handover the product, but they chased and reminded me about request and after 1.5 weeks i was able to hand over the product (it was my fault as i couldnt be at home or convenient place for them to pickup the product). After the product was handed over, with in 4 day i got a brand new earphone with a nice pouch ( i really liked that) and it's been working fine for a month now.Over all fantastic after sales service and good product .

       " \"A few days ago I decided to buy a earphone within the sum of rupees 500. When I saw the earphones on Amazon it was difficult to me to choose between Boat Bassheads 100 and JBL C50HI. I was confused. So I bought both of them and after using for 2 days I returned one of them.In the next day after ordering the Boat Bassheads 100 was arrived. I used it. It is nice. Build quality was not too much durable as expected in this type of budget. Also wires are not tangle free. Its 3.5 mm pin is not L-Shaped so it's provide some pain when you plugged it in with the mobile and put the mobile in the pocket. Sound quality is nice but little bit much louder with full sound. Bass is lower than I expected. The main problem is the mic. The mic is little bit far from your lips so when you need to talk you have to hold it with your hand near to your mouth, it is a pain when talking with someone for a long over earphone. This headphone easy fit in my ear but it becomes uncomfortable when using continuously for over an hour. Earbuds are also uncomfortable while laying on the bed.After two days of ordering JBL C50HI was delivered to me. Build quality is same with the Boat Bassheads 100. But JBL C50HI has a L-shaped 3.5 mm pin which is comfortable option to plug it in when your phone is in the pocket. Sound quality is more than I expected. Too clear, balanced and pleasant sound. Not too loud just the perfect balance. Bass is superb. The mic of this JBL earphone is placed just beside your lips so you don't need to hold it with your hand while talking with someone over earphone. It is also a perfect fit in my ear and too comfortable for long time usage. I also used it while laying on the bed for more than 3 hours continously it is perfect. In this JBL earphone's earbuds marked with 'L' & 'R' so it is easy to discover that which one will fit in which ear. I just love this one.Therefore I returned the Boat Bassheads 100. Hence I will suggest you to buy the JBL C50HI if you confused between the former and latter.But remember Boat has a 1 year warranty and JBL has a 6 months warranty. Your choice.\",\n",

Yes you can get better sound quality, yes you can get better build quality, and better looks, etc. etc. But they'll 100% be more expensive and/or cut other features to stay cheap.

But the earphones at this rate are OP.After 4 months when the sound could be heard only through left ear. So it broke eventually just after 4 months.

Earplug fits properly in the ear that you can hear proper sound while travelling in the train. At the same time you're not completely deaf after putting your earphones.  The crape band provided with this earphone is the main attraction. Band helps you to keep earphone roll proper. Also it helps to hold the earphone on the clothes as it sticks to many materials.

But the Customer Support of \"boat\" was Amazing...!!! Got the old earphones picked up from home and was delivered a new one within a week. For under Rs.400 such an amazing service along with ELITE QUALITY.. #boAt_is_goAt 👌🏻👍🏻👍🏻',\n",

Noise cancellation is such that dont u dare to listen something private in front of others, the same time there is a positive point that u may also use earphone in speaker modes as you will very well listen what is playing inside of them...Regarding Bass.,,,.why the hell does they and others calling it a basshead without knowing its meaning, no bass as i have used it in both android and my apple...Final verdict is that at price point of view this can be considered a better option if you cannot go to the nearby railway station to buy something better in ₹100 only..And i bought the red colour as no other colour option was available and now scared of taking and showing it to others bcoz of its quality and look...Thanks',\n",

It's not a big issue the sound output of the headphones is quite loud. The bass is quite decent as well.The earpods get more comfortable with use and they are a perfect fit. They doesn't seem to come out of my ears as some reviewers have mentioned.The plastic quality is justifiable for the price.Sometimes, my phone doesn't detect the headphones' mic in which case I have to unplug and replug the headphones. This can be quite annoying. Anyway, I think it is an individual issue (my bad luck).Overall, it is a decent pair of headphones that you can get for ₹399.\",\n",

The ear buds are too soft and ya you can wear it for long time.Bass- the only thing which this earphone lacked is if you are a bass lover as I am a big bass lover this is not for you. A very slight bass works. I use S9 plus, I tried to adjust the bass level too but it doesn't work.Noise cancellation- hmm noise cancellation works when you keep volume to high  mid to high level.Note: this earphone is not for I phone.So this is my review what I experienced after using the product.
